# PatiTourn

PatiTourn aims to be a personal competition system for inline skating.

The current competition system is based on an excel table, which, although it fulfills its objectives, is very difficult to manipulate for those people without knowledge of it. It is also not flexible enough to generate match orders and eliminations/scoring. In addition to having a fixed number of events which cannot be modified without this leading to a lot of work.
